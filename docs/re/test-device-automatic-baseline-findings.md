[fastboot oem efi-status]
FAILED (remote: 'unknown command')
```

`oem efi-status` returning `unknown command` confirms the device fell into **stock fastboot** (product: `canoe`), not sibling's FastbootLib.

## Run outcome

**Failed at step 3**: device returned to stock fastboot instead of adb ~10s after StartImage handoff. Script detected the fallback correctly and exited with rc=2.

## Failures observed

### Failure 1: Payload mode/flow mismatch

- **Step**: `[3/5]` (detected immediately after `[2/5]` StartImage handoff)
- **Symptom**: `wait_for_adb_or_fastboot_fallback` found fastboot after ~10s; `fastboot oem efi-status` returned `unknown command`, confirming stock fastboot (not sibling FastbootLib)
- **Timeline**: T+0 sibling fastboot up → T+5 USB drop (StartImage) → T+10 stock fastboot (`canoe`) back. Only 10s between StartImage and stock fastboot reappearing — far too fast for a Linux boot.
- **Actual device state at time of failure**: stock fastboot, product=`canoe`, `oem efi-status` unknown. Confirmed by `fastboot getvar product` and `fastboot oem efi-status` immediately after script exit.
- **Root cause**: `mode-1-auto-debug-verbose.efi` is a chainloader (mode-1 = fakelocked/auto). Its escape path tried to chainload into ABL and fell back to its own FastbootLib (embedded string: `"escape returned %r (falling back to fastboot)"`). Because it was loaded via `oem boot-efi` (RAM staging, not flashed), once it entered its fallback FastbootLib there was no sibling escape table to return to — eventual reset dropped to stock. The correct test flow for this payload is `--escape-with-payload` (stage → `oem boot-efi` → wait for mode-1 FastbootLib → `oem escape` → ABL → Linux), not the default direct `oem boot-efi` flow which expects the payload to boot Linux unaided.
- **Recommended fix category**: **payload-flow-mismatch** (the script was given the wrong payload for the default flow, OR needs to be invoked with `--escape-with-payload`)

### Failure 2 (pre-run): Default payload missing

- **Step**: pre-flight (line 77-78)
- **Symptom**: `error: payload not found: dist/mode-debug.efi` when run without args
- **Root cause**: `mode-debug.efi` was never built for the current branch (`mode-fakelocked`). Only `mode-1-auto-debug-verbose.efi` exists in `dist/`.
- **Recommended fix category**: **silent-fallback** — the script's default `PAYLOAD` should either be auto-discovered from `dist/` (pick the most recent `.efi`), or the error message should suggest the correct invocation for the available payload.

## Captured log dir

`/home/vivy/gbl-chainload/logs/20260510-160014_auto_mode-1-auto-debug-verbose_v2.0-plan1/`

```
-rw-r--r-- 169  20260510-160014_device-monitor.log
-rw-r--r-- 209  fastboot-fallback.txt
-rw-r--r-- 118  fastboot-oem-boot-efi.txt
```

Missing (expected but not created because step 3 failed before step 4):
- `bootloader_log`, `dmesg.txt`, `bootconfig`, `cmdline`, `getprop.boot.txt`, `logfs/`, `recovery.props`

## Plan tasks to add

The baseline revealed one category not explicitly called out in Tasks 3–6:

**New Task: payload-flow-mismatch guard** — Before running `oem boot-efi`, probe whether the staged payload is a chainloader (mode-1/fakelocked) vs a direct-boot payload (mode-debug). If it's a chainloader and `--escape-with-payload` is not set, warn and either auto-set the flag or exit with a clear message. Alternatively, document in the script header which payload types work with which invocation flags, and add a pre-flight check that validates the combination.

The missing `mode-debug.efi` is a build gap, not a script gap — but the script could be more helpful: instead of `error: payload not found`, suggest `./scripts/build.sh --mode debug` or list available `dist/*.efi` files.

## Decision for the plan

**Failed**: step 3 failure with a clear, correctly-diagnosed error message (rc=2, explicit "device is back in fastboot" message). The detection machinery works. Tasks 3–6 still apply:

- **Task 3** (Phoenix stopwatch): still needed — the scenario where Phoenix *does* fire (longer-running payloads) isn't guarded.
- **Task 4** (wire stopwatch): same.
- **Task 5** (state probes): the `device_monitor_in_fastboot_quick` + product-string check would let us distinguish sibling-fastboot from stock-fastboot, which is the key diagnostic needed here.
- **Task 6** (replace fallbacks): step 2's `reboot recovery 2>/dev/null || true` is a silent swallow — if reboot fails, the script proceeds silently. Worth hardening.
- **New task** (payload-flow-mismatch guard): add to plan before Task 7.
